# A Lab Assignment 01
## Overview
The purpose of this README is primarily to document my progress related to the assignment **"A Simple FSM**, including my answers to the given checkpoint questions which are part of the assignment.

## Q&A
**Q: What coordinate axes respond to “forward” and “up” in Unity?**

**A:** 
- "up" relates to the Y-coordinate in 3D world space. It's considered a shorthand for *Vector3(0, 1, 0)*. In 2D space, "up" still relates to the Y-coordinate, but is considered shorthand for *Vector2(0,1)*.
- "forward" relates the Z-coordinate in 3D world space. It's considered a shorthand for *Vector3(0, 0, 1)*.
